# Chip-8 Emulator

**CHIP-8** is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker on his 1802 microprocessor. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800, which were 8-bit microcomputers made in the mid-1970s.

## Features

- **Accurate Emulation**: Faithfully reproduces the behavior of the original CHIP-8 system passing all the [performance tests](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite).
- **Full Instruction Set Implementation**: Correctly implements all CHIP-8 instructions for complete compatibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple controls and a clean interface for loading and playing games.
- **Keyboard Support**: Map CHIP-8 keys to your keyboard for seamless gameplay.
- **Sound Emulation**: Sound effects added for a better experience.
- **10 Different Themes**: Personalize your emulator with 10 retro inspired themes.

## How to use

Step 1: Clone the repository to your local system
Step 2: Use IntelliJ or Eclipse to run the code.
Step 3: Load a Game ROM , which you can downlaod from [here](https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms/tree/master/games) into the emulator. 
Step 3: Click play.
